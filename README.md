Some stuff: scripts, oddities. Probably not a very clean code. But may render useful someday to someone, methinks.


PONG shell script is a collection of destinations for ICMP echo tests (ping utility) used to probe internet connectivity. Two convenient (windows cmd and linux .sh) files.

CONTACT EXPAND is a simple Python script designed to create personal address books for every contact present in a CUCM address list. Takes contacts.csv as input and creates an output.csv which can be uploaded to CUCM.
N.B.: CUCM=="Cisco Unified Communications Manager" is True

ADBLOCK-FILTERS is a collection of filters for adblock I generally use. The motivation to create it came from personal dissatisfaction with many Ad-block filter subscriptions. Existing subscriptions quickly become bloated and slow Firefox to a noticeable degree. In the .min version of the filter list, I removed most of the filters which had a zero HitCount after about a year of using the general filter list. 
To those who would claim that blocking Ads on the Internet is somehow bad: I usually enable the "unobtrusive" option of Adblock; if you wish your ads displayed, make them behave.
