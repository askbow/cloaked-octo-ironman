Some stuff: scripts, oddities. Probably not a very clean code. But may render useful someday to someone, methinks.


PONG shell script is a collection of destinations for ICMP echo tests (ping utility) used to probe internet connectivity. Two convenient (windows cmd and linux .sh) files.

CONTACT EXPAND is a simple Python script designed to create personal address books for every contact present in a CUCM address list. Takes contacts.csv as input and creates an output.csv which can be uploaded to CUCM.
